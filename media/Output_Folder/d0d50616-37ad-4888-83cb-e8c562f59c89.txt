Vijender doesn't have time left for Olympic trials,
says Francis Warren

Vijender Singh might say that he would give Olympic
qualification a shot after doors were thrown open

for professional boxers but his UK-based promoter
Francis Warren today made it clear that India's biggest
star simply does not have the time left to try for a Rio
ticket. The former Olympic and World Championships
bronze-medallist has maintained that if there is an
opportunity for him to give it a shot, he would grab it.
